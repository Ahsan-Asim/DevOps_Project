Containerized Web Application Deployment with Kubernetes
Project Overview
This project focuses on containerizing an existing web application, optimizing its performance and security, and deploying it in scalable environments using Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes. It includes automated deployment workflows with Helm/Kustomize, advanced security configurations, service discovery mechanisms, and persistent storage solutions.

Features
Containerization: Dockerized all services (frontend, backend, database) with optimized Dockerfiles.

Local Development: Set up a smooth development environment using Docker Compose with hot-reloading capabilities.

Kubernetes Deployment: Automated deployment using Helm charts or Kustomize templates.

Security: Implemented RBAC-based access control, service accounts, secrets management, and network policies.

Service Discovery: Configured ingress routing for external traffic and service mesh for internal communication.

Persistent Storage: Deployed databases with StatefulSets and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

Monitoring: Integrated Prometheus and Grafana for application health and performance monitoring.

Technologies Used
Containerization: Docker

Local Development: Docker Compose

Orchestration: Kubernetes

Deployment Automation: Helm, Kustomize

Security: RBAC, Service Accounts, Network Policies

Service Discovery: Ingress, Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)

Persistence: StatefulSets, PVCs

Monitoring Tools: Prometheus, Grafana

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Install Docker and Docker Compose.

Install Kubernetes (Minikube or a cloud provider like AWS EKS, GKE).

Install Helm or Kustomize for deployment automation.

Local Development Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Build and run the development environment:

docker-compose up --build
Access the application at http://localhost:<port>.

Kubernetes Deployment
Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is running.

Deploy the application using Helm:


helm install <release-name> ./helm-chart
Or deploy using Kustomize:


kubectl apply -k ./kustomize/
Access the application via the configured ingress URL.

Security Features
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for restricted access.

Service accounts to limit privileges.

Secrets management for sensitive data like passwords/API keys.

Network policies to control pod-to-pod communication.

Monitoring Setup
Install Prometheus and Grafana in your Kubernetes cluster.

Access Grafana dashboards to monitor application performance.
